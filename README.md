This is a personal finance tracker project that I had been working on that helps users to track their expenditure. It allows users to input their income i.e. the source, the amount and budget for it accordingly.
I used VS Code as the environment while working on the project and set up a CSV file where transactions will be stored for simplicity. A user can therefor add transactions to the file, fetch the stored transactions, make changes to it and delete them.
This being a user friendly project, I had to implement tkinter which is a graphical user interface(GUI) that will allow users to input and list transactions by displaying a textbox for better data organization
This video https://youtu.be/yQSEXcf6s2I?list=PLCC34OHNcOtoC6GglhF3ncJ5rLwQrLGnV clearly explains better on the implementation of tkinter.
After the income has been set, the user can now set the budget for various items and alert them when they exceed it and finally visualization features (pie charts) to represent the users financial data whether over time or category.
To access the code, one must have the git extension where one will be directed to a remote repository from github where the personal finance tracker repository is so as to access the code.
